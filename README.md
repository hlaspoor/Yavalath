# Yavalath

## Object of the Game

The goal of Yavalath is to place four stones in a row or to force an opponent to place three stones in a row.

## Play

The game begins with an empty board.

Each player has an allocated color: White or Black.

Starting with White, players take turns placing a stone of their color in any empty cell on the board.

Since the first player has a distinct advantage, the pie rule is generally used to the game fair.  This rule allows the second player to switch colors as his first move.

## End of Game

The game ends in one of the following cases:
* One of the players wins a game by making a line of four (or more) stones of his color.
* One of the players loses a game by making a line of three stones of his color without making a line of four stones the same time.
* The board fills up before either player wins or loses. In this case the game ends up in a draw.
